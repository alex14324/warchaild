# Overview 

This Denial Of Service suite comprises of the following features :



1. CloudBust :- Cloudbust a.k.a AETHON is a cloudflare resolver that looks into the cloudflare protected 
                website for misconfigured DNS configuration
                basically uses dnsdumpster.com as its resolver :)and identifies the backend IP of the website.
                We will add more updates in upcoming time.

2. HTTP Flood :- HTTP Flood is a type of Denial of Service attack in which the attacker manipulates HTTP and POST unwanted requests in order
                 to attack a web server or application. 
                 In an HTTP flood, the HTTP clients such as web browser interact with an application  
                 or server to send HTTP requests. The aim of the attack is when to compel the server
                 to allocate as many resources as possible to serving the attack thus denying legitimate users access to the server's resources.
                 ALISA is a http d.o.s tool written in such a way to suck all of the website's resources and is a layer 7 D.O.S tool.

3. TCP SYN Flood :- A SYN flood is a form of denial-of-service attack in which an attacker sends a succession of SYN requests to a target's system in  
                    an attempt to consume enough server resources to make the system unresponsive to legitimate traffic.

4. UDP Flood :- A UDP flood attack is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), a sessionless/connectionless computer 
                networking protocol.
